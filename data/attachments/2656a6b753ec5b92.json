Carrier fees are passthrough fees charged by carriers in relation to numbers hosted on their network. These vary based on the sending number type, content sent and in certain cases compliance status. For example, AT&T charges a specific fee for unregistered 10DLC traffic sent to numbers hosted on its network. As of July 2023, Telnyx does not charge a markup on carrier fees.
